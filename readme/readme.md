# Readme how to work with new kinesis 360 pro
Not sure how about others, but the description sucks on multiple-levels.
I mean, if you need extremly descriptive description read it, but I need small chunks of information


## Installing new firmware/layout

1. get firmware from somebody, who areleady prepared it or from official site(I don't know
what woudl happend if you mix kinesis firmware version)
2. Unpack it
3. Turn off both sides
4. Connect **left** side to pc, then double press reset button(hidden under thumb keys, in middle) will make
board go green(#420).
5. That will open folder of the side and there you copy **left** firmware part, afterwards it will disconect and install firmware itself
6. Unplug **left** side

7. Plug **right** side
8. double press reset button(hidden under thumb keys, in middle) will make
board go green(#420).
9. That will open folder of the side and there you copy **right** firmware part, afterwards it will disconect and install firmware itself
10. Unplug **right** side
11. Turn left and then right side
12. Profit!!


## Firmware reset

1. use firmware provided by kinesis
2. unpack it (there will be only one firwamre for both sides)
3. follow sam einstuction as for installing new firmware

(help with weird situiation as bluetooth not connectiong)


## Interesting shortcuts
Hotkey is number in circle
* Mod + 1(hotkey) -> booting for left side
* Mod + 3(hotkey) -> booting for right side

* Mod +2(hotkey) -> ??
* Mod +4(hotkey) -> both sides battery health


## 360 Pro sucks at
* tripple indicator lights of both sides feels like sunlike lighthouses that will burn your eyes out (simple solution - buy brown see through tape and tape small strips over them - though sucks how much it must consume)
* Manual could me much better structured
* TODO
