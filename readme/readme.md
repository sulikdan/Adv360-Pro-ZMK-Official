# Readme how to work with new kinesis 360 pro
Not sure how about others, but the description sucks on multiple-levels.
I mean, if you need extremly descriptive description read it, but I need small chunks of information


## Installing new firmware/layout

1. get firmware from somebody, who areleady prepared it or from official site(I don't know
what woudl happend if you mix kinesis firmware version)
2. Unpack it
3. Turn off both sides
4. Connect **left** side to pc, then double press reset button(hidden under thumb keys, in middle) will make
board go green(#420).
5. That will open folder of the side and there you copy **left** firmware part, afterwards it will disconect and install firmware itself
6. Unplug **left** side

7. Plug **right** side
8. double press reset button(hidden under thumb keys, in middle) will make
board go green(#420).
9. That will open folder of the side and there you copy **right** firmware part, afterwards it will disconect and install firmware itself
10. Unplug **right** side
11. Turn left and then right side
12. Profit!!


## Firmware reset

1. use firmware provided by kinesis
2. unpack it (there will be only one firwamre for both sides)
3. follow sam einstuction as for installing new firmware

(help with weird situiation as bluetooth not connectiong)


## Interesting shortcuts
Hotkey is number in circle
* Mod + 1(hotkey) -> booting for left side
* Mod + 3(hotkey) -> booting for right side

* Mod +2(hotkey) -> ??
* Mod +4(hotkey) -> both sides battery health

### Getting stuck with connection??
If you have trouble that keyboard doesnt want to connect
to PC with message "not able to" try to:
1. Removing device
2. Press Mod + Win-key

## 360 Pro sucks at
* tripple indicator lights of both sides feels like sunlike lighthouses that will burn your eyes out (simple solution - buy brown see through tape and tape small strips over them - though sucks how much it must consume)
* Manual could me much better structured
* TODO

# Update 12.12.2023
## BASE Info
Still learning. It's getting better. Currently stuck with 10 letters(no special characters) giving it like 25min a day on site - https://www.keybr.com/ , maybe less. Feels hardcore.
TBH I feel, when Im not using my head thinking whats were, I'm much more precise. Haven't had yet time to play with specific mappings. Will do, when I learn base letters and then special characters ...

## Keyboard and stuff
Bougt the pro 360(logically :)), also with pads. It seems it is best working when they are shoulder appart, though that raises a question, what to do and where to put mouse(will see over the time).
Tried to play a game -> disaster. Im waiting till I get through all letters. Conenction(the moment you want to connect) is buggy, need to turn off and on BTH in PC and then it connects(not always, when I use different PC ....) maybe I do soemthing wrong.
